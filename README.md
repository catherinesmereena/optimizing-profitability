# optimizing-profitability
Profit optimization strategy using linear programming and Excel Solver for a hardware company's expansion. Includes constraints analysis, sensitivity evaluation, and decision support modeling.

Optimizing Profitability: Strategic Expansion Analysis

This project presents a linear programming solution to help a Northern hardware company optimize inventory allocation and maximize profit as it prepares to launch a new distribution center. The analysis considers budget constraints, warehouse space, and marketing goals while identifying the most profitable product mix.

##  Objectives
- Maximize total monthly profit from product sales
- Determine optimal inventory levels under budget and space limits
- Incorporate marketing constraints into the decision-making model
- Conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate potential profitability under changing scenarios

##  Linear Programming Model

**Objective Function:**  
Maximize profit = 219.99x‚ÇÅ + 299.99x‚ÇÇ + 379.99x‚ÇÉ + 142.99x‚ÇÑ

**Decision Variables:**  
- x‚ÇÅ = Pressure Washers  
- x‚ÇÇ = Go-Karts  
- x‚ÇÉ = Generators  
- x‚ÇÑ = Water Pumps

**Constraints:**  
- Budget: 349.99x‚ÇÅ + 379.99x‚ÇÇ + 530x‚ÇÉ + 500x‚ÇÑ ‚â§ 130,000  
- Space: 25x‚ÇÅ + 40x‚ÇÇ + 25x‚ÇÉ + 6.25x‚ÇÑ ‚â§ 12,300 sq ft  
- Promotion Rule 1: 0.7x‚ÇÅ + 0.7x‚ÇÇ ‚àí 0.3x‚ÇÉ ‚àí 0.3x‚ÇÑ ‚â• 0  
- Promotion Rule 2: x‚ÇÉ ‚àí 2x‚ÇÑ ‚â• 0  
- Non-negativity: x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, x‚ÇÉ, x‚ÇÑ ‚â• 0

##  Key Results
- **Optimal Monthly Profit:** $60,391.82  
- **Optimal Inventory Mix:**  
  - Pressure Washers: 0  
  - Go-Karts: 146.9  
  - Generators: 228.5  
  - Water Pumps: 114.2  
- **Insight:** Pressure Washers yielded no profit and were excluded from the optimal solution

##  Sensitivity Analysis
- **Budget:** Shadow price = $0 ‚Üí current $130,000 budget is sufficient  
- **Warehouse Space:** Shadow price = $11.03 ‚Üí each extra square foot yields ~$11 more in profit  
- **Additional Investment:** $35,740 budget increase = ~$23,596 more in profit  
- **Recommendation:** Expand warehouse to 12,866.5 sq ft for optimal return
